# Toulouse dataviz presentation

This is all resources from my Toulouse dataviz presentation about Python tools for data visualization.
It includes my slides (in English and French), my notebook with all the examples and a conda/mamba environment used for the notebook (`conda_environment.yaml`).

To play the slides, download this repo and open the html file with your browser (tested with chromium and brave).
